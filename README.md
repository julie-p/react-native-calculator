# React Native test
We'd like a very simple calculator app. It should allow user to do simple calculation (+,-,*,/).

## Essential requirements
* Built using React Native and modern JavaScript.
* Works on both iOS and Android devices

## Guidance
The goal of this test is for you to demonstrate your experience and abilities for building cross-platform mobile apps. Show us an app that's simple to maintain and behaves well on different mobile devices. We may test your app on real or emulated mobile devices, running Android or iOS; you don't need to support smart watches or iPad!

The most important parts are the logic of the app and the performance.


## Bonus

In order of importance:
1. Add a settings page in which user can see some info.
The real bonus here is that you have some sort of navigation in the app, not the content of the page.

2. A nice design

## Submission
Please commit to this repo. Try to do clean commits as we will look at it too.
Let me know when you're happy with it by sending me an email; when you do so, please give me an indication of how much time you spent on the test.

Have fun!
